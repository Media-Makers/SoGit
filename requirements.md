List the functionality of your product. This will consist of tasks such as the following:

An admin can create and delete user accounts
A user can update their profile information
A user can search all of the products in the inventory
Data Flow
Describe the flow of data in your application. Write out what happens from the time the user begins using the app to the time the user is done with the app. Think about the “Happy Path” of the application. Describe through visuals and text what requests are made, and what data is processed, in addition to any other details about how the user moves through the site.

Non-Functional Requirements (301 & 401 only)
Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the application but still important to the app.

Examples include:

Security
Usability
Testability
etc….
Pick 2 non-functional requirements and describe their functionality in your application.

If you are stuck on what non-functional requirements are, do a quick online search and do some research. Write a minimum of 3-5 sentences to describe how the non-functional requirements fits into your app.

You MUST describe what the non-functional requirement is and how it will be implemented. Simply saying “Our project will be testable for testibility” is NOT acceptable. Tell us how, why, and what.
